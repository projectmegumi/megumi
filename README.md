Project Megumi
==============
A subcompare-like website, written in Ruby on Rails.

Site
----
Web is hosting on Heroku for easy deployment:

* https://megumi-staging.herokuapp.com (Staging site, used to test stuff)
* https://megumi-production.herokuapp.com (Nothing here yet.)

We're running on PostgreSQL free tier.

Since Heroku doesn't have a file storage, we're using Sugoi's server for hosting
assets for now.

Team
----
* @sikachu - Coding.
* @Fyurie - Server, motivational support.
